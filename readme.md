## Business Context & Stakeholder Requirements

> **Note:** The following business scenario and stakeholder interactions are AI-generated for training and portfolio development purposes. This simulated business context provides realistic practice in stakeholder communication and business requirement translation - essential skills for data science professionals.

### Project Stakeholder: Marcus Chen - CEO & Founder, TechMart E-commerce

**Company Background:**
TechMart is a growing e-commerce platform processing millions of transactions monthly with current annual revenue of $12 million. The company has experienced significant growth but lacks data-driven insights for strategic decision-making.

### Primary Business Objective
**Target:** Increase annual revenue by 25% ($3M growth from $12M to $15M) within 12 months without proportionally increasing marketing spend.

**Core Challenge:** Current customer acquisition cost has increased 40% while average order value remained flat, requiring optimization of existing customer base rather than expanded acquisition.

### Stakeholder Requirements & Priorities

#### Priority 1: Identify "Golden Customers"
**Business Need:** Understand who the most valuable customers are to focus marketing efforts effectively.

**Specific Requirements:**
- Customer segmentation based on profit contribution (not just revenue)
- Customer Lifetime Value calculations for each segment
- Characteristics and behavioral patterns of high-value customers
- Targeting strategy for acquiring similar customers

**Success Metrics:**
- Identification of top 20% customers contributing 80% of profit
- Clear customer segment profiles with actionable characteristics
- ROI projections for targeted marketing campaigns

#### Priority 2: Reduce Customer Churn ("Stop the Bleeding")
**Business Need:** Address the issue of one-time buyers who never return to the platform.

**Specific Requirements:**
- Analysis of customer retention patterns by segment
- Identification of "bargain hunters" vs "potential loyalists"
- Category-specific retention strategies
- Cost-effective retention recommendations

**Success Metrics:**
- Churn rate analysis by customer segment and product category
- Clear strategy on which customers to invest in retaining vs letting go
- ROI analysis of retention campaigns

#### Priority 3: Maximize Transaction Value (Cross-selling)
**Business Need:** Increase average order value through strategic product recommendations.

**Specific Requirements:**
- Product association analysis for cross-selling opportunities
- Focus on high-margin accessory and ecosystem product recommendations
- Implementation-ready recommendation rules
- Revenue impact projections

**Success Metrics:**
- Potential revenue increase: $600K annually from optimized cross-selling
- Accessory attachment rate improvements
- Average order value increases by product category

### Project Timeline & Check-ins

**Week 2 Check-in:**
- Initial data exploration findings
- Preliminary customer segment identification
- Early insights on churn patterns and cross-selling opportunities

**Week 4 Progress Review:**
- Complete customer segmentation with CLV calculations
- Detailed retention strategy recommendations
- Cross-selling rules with revenue projections

**Week 6 Business Case Presentation:**

- ROI projections and business impact analysis
- Technical implementation requirements for marketing and development teams

### Analytical Plan Framework

Based on stakeholder requirements, the analytical approach focuses on three strategic areas:

1. **Customer Value Optimization:** RFM+ analysis incorporating profit margins, not just revenue
2. **Strategic Churn Management:** Data-driven decisions on retention investment
3. **Revenue Maximization:** Market basket analysis for ecosystem and accessory cross-selling

## Project Overview

This end-to-end data science project analyzes customer behavior patterns in a large-scale e-commerce platform to uncover actionable insights for business growth. The project demonstrates comprehensive data science skills including data wrangling, statistical analysis, machine learning, and business intelligence reporting.

**Business Problem**: Understanding customer behavior to optimize sales, improve customer experience, and identify growth opportunities in the e-commerce sector.

## Dataset Information

**Primary Dataset**: E-commerce Events History Dataset

| `user_session` | String | Unique session identifier | a23f5204-c3a6-4b23-8d2c-b05b68e5dc4f |

### Data Quality Notes
- **Missing Values**: Significant missing data in `category_code`, `brand`, and `user_session` fields
- **Data Types**: Mixed categorical and numerical features requiring preprocessing
- **Scale**: Large dataset requiring efficient processing techniques
- **Time Span**: 6 months of data providing seasonal variation analysis opportunities

**Dataset Characteristics**:
- Real-world e-commerce transaction data
- Multiple data quality issues (missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies)
- Large volume suitable for big data processing techniques
- Rich temporal and categorical features
